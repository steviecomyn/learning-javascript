**Requirement Specification**

You are required to write a program called MyFunctions which carries out both string functions and number functions. The system will have a menu which will present the user with three choices:

**Option 1** — will generate a username in the format of first initial and last name. The user will be prompted to enter their first and last name.

**Option 2** — will calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user. The factorial of a number is defined as the product of that number and the number which is one less than it and the number which is one less than that, etc. down to 1. For example, the factorial of 5 (or 5! as it is correctly written) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

**Option 3** – Quit - will display a goodbye message and end the program

The menu is required to run until the user enters the quit option.
You will write the program as a standalone application.
You should base your program on the detailed design provided by your tutor.

You must:

*   Use variables appropriately.
*   Use Programming constructs (selection and iteration – at least one ‘if’ statement and at least one loop)
*   Use functions and parameter passing (at least one built-in function and at least one that you have written)
*   Test the code using a recognised test strategy and given test cases
*   Document the results of testing
*   Apply meaningful names to variables and functions
*   Ensure that code is well laid out to aid maintainability
*   Internally document the code by adding comments
